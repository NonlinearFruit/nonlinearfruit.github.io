# About Me
I love learning, creating and merrymaking. Maybe the best way to summarize is through some examples.

## Learning
Here are some things I like learning about:

 - Programming techniques
 - Esoteric programming languages
 - Pure and applied math
 - Linguistics
 
There are a couple resources that I particularly enjoy using:

 - [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse)
 - [Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/find-by-topic/)
 - [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)
 - [Programming Puzzles and Code Golf](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com)
 
## Creating
Here are some things I have created:

 - Minecraft (3,2) turing machine
 - [Domino logic gates](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/82938/golf-all-the-16-logic-gates-with-2-inputs-and-1-output/91472#91472)
 - [Minimalist Password Manager](https://gist.github.com/NonlinearFruit/7b6f72f97f0d70086f3f229fbf23850f)
 - [Windows enhancing AHK script](https://github.com/NonlinearFruit/Ultimate)
 - Origami
 
## Merrymaking
A lot of my merrymaking activities revolve around interacting with others or picking up a skill that is fun, novel and teachable:

 - Slack lining
 - Juggling
 - Cude solving
 - Rock slinging
 - Board games
