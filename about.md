# About Me
I love learning, creating and merrymaking. Maybe the best way to summarize is through some examples.

## Learning

## Creating
Fun things I have created that aren't on GitHub (yet):

 - Pairing container
 - [Domino logic gates](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/82938/golf-all-the-16-logic-gates-with-2-inputs-and-1-output/91472#91472)
 - Turing machine test harness
 - Minecraft (3,2) turing machine
 - Origami
 
## Merrymaking
Two examples with a little bit of context, paper airplane golf and IT.

Paper airplane golf is disc golf but `s/disc/paper airplace/g`. Bring your own paper airplane. Start at Alice's desk, first hole is Bob's trash can. Then from Bob's can to Charlie's can. A couple friends and I invented this and have iterated on it for a while. We had so many rule questions mid-game, that we put the official disc golf roles in a git repo as markdown and started evolving them for interior office use. Pro-tip: Find a nice set of 10 consecuative trash cans. This creates 9 holes. Reversing the order of the trash cans, creates 9 new holes. Then you have an easy to remember 18-hole course.

IT is basically the trickshot-reproducing basketball game, HORSE. Only `s/basketball/nerf gun/g`. Call a trickshot (eg: through the chair, hit the solo cup), make the trickshot, then the other players need to reproduce it. Fail to reproduce the trickshot and you get a letter (first an `I`, then a `T`). Get two letters and you are out. A friend and I invented this. It also ended up having a git repo for the rules as the expanded to resolve different pain points, disputes and weird edge cases. Pro-tip: Sudden death is really helpful to have sorted out in case the game is going too long. We would choose a hard shot and then round-robin through the participants until someone made the shot.

Kind of an onsite work focus here. I have also iterated on remote merrymaking (eg: pairing container) and would love to talk about it. Could be a good interview question :thinking:
